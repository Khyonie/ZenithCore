(This is just so I can keep my throught in order)

Goal:
Create an instance of ZenithNPC, with a name and profile.
Calling ZenithNPC#spawn() will spawn the NPC into the world.
Calling ZenithNPC#setTarget____() will change the NPC's pathfinding to prioritize a certain behaviour

A ZenithNPC will have two associated entities: 
- An EntityPlayer instance that can be seen by players,
- An EntityZombie that performs pathfinding and most real-world actions.

ZenithNPCs can have the following behaviours:
- Stand still
- Look at player
- Float
- Move to location
- Move to entity, attack entity

NPCs cannot have duplicate names, but if two NPCs share the same name, one will be renamed and aliased.
